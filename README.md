# Travel Agency Back-End Migration
### Western Governors University – D288 Back-End Programming
**Student:** Brattynn Thompson\
**GitLab Repository:** [https://gitlab.com/wgu-gitlab-environment/student-repos/bth1352/d288-back-end-programming.git]

## Project Overview
This project is a Spring Boot-based back-end application developed as part of a college-level Back-End Programming course. It serves as a modernized replacement for a legacy vacation booking system, featuring RESTful APIs, JPA-based data access, input validation, and seamless integration with a prebuilt Angular front end. Built using Spring Data JPA, Lombok, and MySQL, the project emphasizes clean architecture, modular design (controllers, services, DAOs, and entities), and professional Git version control to simulate real-world development workflows.
